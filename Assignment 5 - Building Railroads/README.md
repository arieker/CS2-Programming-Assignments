## Building Railroads (Graph Algorithms)

Objective: Students will apply concepts of graph algorithms in this programming assignment.

Assignment Description: You have been hired by the Knights Train Company to develop some
sort of cost-efficient railroad system to allow students to travel all over the state of Florida. The
company wants to spend the least amount of money on developing some sort of railroad system.
In order to be super cost efficient, the company decided that the railroad system also cannot have
any cycles (hint think about how disjoint sets can help; a sample disjoint set class was posted in
the assignment page). That means students will have to stop at a couple of stops if they want to
get to their respective destination. The company has also provided you with all possible tracks
and their cost to design the railroad system. In this assignment, you will apply Kruskalâ€™s
Algorithm in designing such a cost-efficient railroad system.
