Assignment Description: Kenny is with his friends at the county fair. They got tickets to enter
in the magical corn maze. The maze consists of teleportation pads, that allow you jump through
various spots in the maze. Kenny is really scared to go in, but his friends promise they will
always be together in the corn maze. Unfortunately, they got separated and now Kenny is alone
in the corn maze. Kenny is freaking out until he gets a text from his friend that they are waiting
for him to get to the end. They promise to guide Kenny to the end. However, his phone has a low
battery, so he must hurry (or else he is trap there). Kennyâ€™s friends remind him that there are
some magical teleportation pads within the maze that will help him get out fast before his phone
battery dies. However, there are some that can send Kenny to dead ends. Your goal is to get
Kenny out of the magical maze before his phone dies (hence the running time constraint
restriction).
